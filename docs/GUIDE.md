# CareerOS guide

Track current checkpoints, daily actions, and saved work.
Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite; data stays in your browser.

The site and repository are now named **CareerOS**, at `/CareerOS/`. The previous
`/CareerHQ/` address is no longer the deployment path. Storage keys and backup format
remain unchanged: both paths use the same `https://zanark.github.io` origin, so the
same browser profile retains its existing progress. Do not clear site data to fix a
loading problem. Different browsers/devices still need a private backup transfer.

## What this prototype does

- Keeps one current checkpoint per mission, with source-defined prerequisites.
- Uses a branching mission tree and top-down checkpoint flowcharts, with connected nodes,
  an evidence/criteria decision, and a practice loop. Includes responsive and printable views.
- Separates **practice recorded** from **checkpoint completed**. Completion requires
  an artifact and explicit confirmation of every criterion; it is not AI-graded.
- Builds up to three daily actions. Gentle capacity offers at most one small action,
  within 15 minutes. Background missions keep their place.
- Provides evidence search/filtering, event history, a tab-local focus timer,
  an opportunity pipeline, and self-assessed interview readiness.
- Saves browser-local state and supports private JSON backup/export and replacement import.
- Tracks freelance research and spaced recall separately from checkpoint completion.
- Preserves previous roadmap versions and requires confirmation before adopting new definitions.
- Provides an interactive **Tutorial** using a separate, temporary practice workspace.
  Try real controls without changing your progress, theme preference, or existing focus session.
- Includes an optional **Keep going** page before Overview: your supplied past
  accomplishments and actual saved work, with sources rather than motivational quotes.
- Uses **DeepSeaFoam** dark and **Harbor Daylight** light palettes. The header switch
  animates sunrise/sunset, remembers your choice, and respects reduced motion.

The supplied operation documents define nine missions. Tracking granularity is explicit:

| Mission | Documented tracking |
| --- | --- |
| Pattern Forge | 48 checkpoints: the unchanged 5-checkpoint HashMap start plus 43 DSA topic reviews, across 14 stages |
| System Forge | 72 modules across 9 phases, plus 15 independently selectable case-study references and a separate concepts map |
| Escape Velocity | 34 checkpoints, plus 45 independent labs, cases, diagnostics and capstones |
| Fabric Core | 32 canonical checkpoints across 5 stages, with detailed study material and 20 additional lab playbooks |
| Blueprint | 91 numbered modules plus Day 0; supplemental AI/SF practice and eight capstones stay outside the required chain |
| Credential Forge | 53 core study modules; the Data learning branch is optional and paid exams are separate decisions |
| Neural Edge | 28 modules across 7 source phases, plus cases, transfer drills and portfolio choices |
| Algorithm Forge | 34 checkpoints across the complete 6-stage contest curriculum; older forecast versions remain available |
| Side Income | 104 modules across 13 stages, with cases, templates and the separate private freelance ledger |

The latest editions contain **497 tracked checkpoints**. The seven expanded mission workbooks
also provide **806 browsable source units and 5,944 practice, transfer and diagnostic prompts**.
Repeated source exercise contexts are retained; this is not a claim of 5,944 distinct autograded problems.
Study material and tracking definitions are not imported personal achievements.
The original PDFs and private progress/biographical sections are not published. See the source notes
for conflicts, granularity choices and unverified certification availability.
There is no actual AI agent, cloud workspace, authentication, or multi-device sync.
The AI-engineering mission is a learning roadmap, not a connected AI service.

## Start using it

### Your 3D career view

The website now opens **[Career graph](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/home)**.
Drag to rotate the network in genuine 3D, scroll or pinch to zoom, and select a
node for its record. **Frame all** restores the whole view; **Focus node** centers
the selected item. **Full screen** expands the scene and its controls; Escape returns.
The named list and keyboard rotation controls provide another
way to navigate. **Overview** remains the compact tracker at `#/hq`.

Green means recorded completion; orange means not marked complete. Notes, source
references and untracked expanded curriculum remain distinct reference nodes.
Archived completions retain their version context, and the preserved DSA prefix
is not double-counted. Daily actions and past accomplishments do not automatically
complete their associated checkpoints. Mission and layer filters only affect the view.
Thicker, glowing orange links represent actual graph connections. Decorative arcs
orbit the outside of the sphere at individual speeds; their front/back segments
remain visible by default. **Clear center** optionally masks those projected shell
segments without hiding real connections. Sparks and glow are atmosphere, not extra nodes.
Connection lines bend away from your cursor but stay attached to their endpoints.
Zooming, dragging and inspecting do not pause automatic motion. **Pause animation**
is a separate control; **Auto-rotate** controls the camera orbit. Reduced motion
starts paused, and manual navigation remains available.

**Shared skill links** connect specifically related checkpoints across the
roadmaps. Select a node and expand **Connections** to see the reason, the two
curriculum citations, and a button to inspect its neighbor. These are curated
comparisons, not source-declared prerequisites or equivalent mastery. Different
roadmap versions and archived work are not guessed into new relationships.
The toggle hides these lines without hiding nodes or changing progress. Connections
outside your current filters remain listed with an explicit **Reveal and inspect**
action; it reveals the necessary view filters. The inspector stays collapsible.

**Copy brief for AI** copies a local snapshot for you to review and paste into your
chosen assistant. CareerOS does not send it to an AI service or automatically make
career decisions. If WebGL is unavailable, the page says so and keeps the named
node list usable; it does not pretend a flat fallback is a 3D visualization.

**CareerOS provides study material and tracks evidence; it is not an autonomous teacher or grader.**
Use the built-in prompts with your editor, authorized lab or coach. Record actual results
on the saved tracker. No reading, diagram click or elapsed time proves the work was done.

### The focus room and distraction log

Open **Daily plan -> Full screen focus**. The large timer sits in front of frosted
glass, with a subdued, genuine 3D career core behind it. The background moves gently
only while the timer runs and **Ambient motion** is enabled; reduced motion stops it.
It is visual ambience, not an AI processing work. If browser fullscreen or WebGL is
unavailable, the window-filling room still provides the timer and recording controls.

**I got distracted** saves one self-reported button press immediately. Its session,
timestamp and elapsed running-clock time are retained, including whether it was
reported while paused. It does not infer the onset, duration or cause of a distraction.
Only a successful write increases the saved count; storage failures are visible.

The room and compact timer share one countdown. Closing the room does not stop it.
Pause/continue preserve its length; a changed capacity applies to the next session.
**Reset** resets the clock, not the saved reports. **Focus history** on Daily plan
shows recent records, and normal **Export backup / Import backup** includes the full
session/event log for later analysis, not just the displayed count.

The countdown is tab-local. A reload starts a ready timer, while saved reports remain.
An earlier record with no ending is labeled as such, not assumed completed or still
running. A timer ending is not evidence of uninterrupted attention or checkpoint mastery.
The log has bounded record limits and the same 5 MiB workspace limit; a full store
rejects new writes explicitly rather than deleting old records.

Tutorial focus records stay in the temporary practice workspace. A real timer can
continue while the tutorial is open, but an automatic ending is saved only after
leaving practice, subject to the normal storage/conflict protections.

### The complete mission workbooks

Open **[Practice libraries](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/practice)** from Missions
or Operation documents. Each expanded mission has its own source-based library with
mental models, worked reasoning, concepts, exercises, transfer tasks, diagnostics,
mastery evidence and recovery guidance.

Search the full selected workbook, filter by stage/reference group or material type,
then choose a module, case, lab bank or reference. Source page numbers remain visible.
Shared learning rules are factored into **How to use this roadmap**. Missing source
fixtures, inconsistent labels and other limitations are stated rather than filled with
invented source content. The app does not run labs, grade answers or verify credentials.

The seven new editions are v3. An older tracker remains unchanged until you explicitly
**Adopt documented roadmap**; export a backup first. Adoption archives the exact old
position and preserves saved records, but does not guess that a broader old milestone
proves a different detailed module. DSA's verified append remains its separate exception.
Independent references are available even before adoption and never become fake progress.

### The appended DSA roadmap

**Using the sourcebook with NotebookLM:** the optional **NotebookLM companion - keep
one tracker** panel appears on DSA and its practice library. Keep day-by-day coaching
in NotebookLM; copy its short handoff into the existing evidence description rather
than maintaining a second tracker. Relevant sections include a few correctness reminders.
No 90-day checklist, R0 checkpoint, progress reset or extra recording fields are added.
The sourcebook's coaching/retention labels do not replace CareerOS's existing recall rules.

The expanded 105-page DSA/LeetCode PDF, now named **LeetCode_RoadMap.pdf**, is part of **Pattern Forge v3**.
The original five HashMap checkpoints and their branches are unchanged.
The extension adds 43 topic reviews in the dependency-aware order from Appendix A,
not the chapter-number order.

If your DSA tracker is already v2, open **DSA → Append expanded roadmap** and
review the confirmation. It preserves your genuine HashMap completions, current
checkpoint, blocker, saved work and history. If all five were finished, the next
checkpoint becomes the foundation bridge; those five are counted once, not again
because an archive exists. Existing v1 trackers still use the older explicit
archive-and-start adoption path. Export a backup before either operation.

**[DSA practice library](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/dsa/1)** includes all
50 source sections, 939 problem appearances and 371 distinct problem IDs. Repeated
appearances are intentional. Use the section selector, row-difficulty filter and
problem search; **Open practice set** on the mission opens the relevant section.
The full roadmap inspector links to each appended topic's practice too.

The sets are curated choices, not 939 required completions. Foundation/Core/Stress
are the source's group labels and do not always match a row's Easy/Medium/Hard label.
Both are preserved. Opening links or browsing ahead never records work or unlocks
checkpoints. Actual practice is logged through the current mission checkpoint.
Some source problems use later techniques: follow the section guidance rather than
treating an early Hard example as a prerequisite for learning the basics.

The requested append places a **foundation bridge** after the retained HashMap
track rather than inserting retroactive requirements. The source omits a phase
placement for Divide & Conquer; its core is placed after recursion and sorting,
with advanced counting revisited later. These are explicit integration decisions.
Topic order within each phase is the app's conservative learning sequence, not a
claim that the PDF specifies a formal prerequisite edge between every pair.
Protocol, revision, practice ladder and other study-method sections remain available
throughout, not a mandatory late checklist.

### First, find the PDF content

**System Design has two supplied sources:** the one-page `system-design.pdf` is
the concepts map; the 183-page `SystemDesign_RoadMap.pdf` is the problem-solving
curriculum. **System Design → Full roadmap** offers **Problems & exercises**,
**Concepts**, and **My saved tracker**, regardless of your saved version.
The concepts view preserves 20 source sections and 160 concept placements.
The problems view includes 72 tracked modules and all 15 case-study references.

Use **Find a concept** to center a term at readable size. **My saved tracker**
returns to your actual System Forge checkpoints. The [concept browser](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/system-concepts)
also presents every branch at ordinary text size, with search and source attribution.
Repeated patterns stay under each source category. The source asks for an overview
of the cloud patterns, not mastery of all of them. This concepts reference adds no
checkpoint gates and records no completion. The [problems browser](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/system-practice)
provides all 146 module practice prompts, 15 cases with 195 scope/deep-dive prompts,
transfer drills, module-specific gates and eight periodic diagnostics.

Existing System v1/v2 users must explicitly **Adopt documented roadmap** to start
the module tracker. Their old position, completion evidence, plans and recall
records remain archived; they are not guessed into completion of the more detailed
modules. New modules start unconfirmed. Export a backup before adopting.
Case studies remain independently selectable practice, not mandatory serial
checkpoints; the source does not prescribe case-to-case prerequisites. Record actual
case work as evidence for the active relevant module rather than treating a link
click as a completed case. Source component outlines are discussion prompts, not
production execution diagrams. Specialized patterns begin at overview depth and
are deepened when an exercise needs them.

1. Open [Operation documents](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/sources).
2. Choose an area from **Mission**. For example, **DSA · Pattern Forge**.
3. Read **Sources, scope and supporting material**, then use **Roadmap stage** to
   browse its stages. Expand **Topics and completion criteria in this stage** for the detail.
4. Compare **Documented roadmap** with **Active tracker**. If the active tracker is
   older than the documented edition, export a backup, review the new definition, then select **Adopt documented
   roadmap** only when you want to switch. Old progress is archived, not transferred as
   completion credit. If the versions match, no adoption is needed.
5. Select **Open current tracker** to work on that mission.

On a mission page, **Full roadmap** beside its name opens every stage together.
For **DSA**, it opens the complete curriculum from the **EXPANDED** PDF even when
your saved tracker is still v1 or v2. **Roadmap view → My saved tracker** shows your
older position; **Complete curriculum** is a read-only preview until you explicitly
adopt it. Previewing never resets, remaps or awards progress. **System Design**
opens the complete problem curriculum, with Concepts and the saved tracker available separately.
All seven expanded missions also open the complete current curriculum, with the genuine
saved version separately selectable. Independent practice/reference nodes link to their
full study pages without adding completion gates.

It starts at **Fit all**, not a stage filter. Use **Find a topic** to jump directly
to DFS, BFS, DP or another DSA topic at readable size, with its requirements and
practice-set link below. On a tracked version, the actual current checkpoint has
a bright, gently pulsing **You are here** highlight; an unadopted preview does not
invent a current step or mark its topics complete.
Use **Current checkpoint** for a readable close-up, **+ / -** or **100%** to change zoom,
and drag, scroll or swipe to explore. Select a node for its action and completion criteria;
this only inspects it and never changes the current checkpoint. **Escape** or **Close dialog**
returns to the mission. Reduced-motion settings keep the highlight static.
**Hide details** collapses the entire bottom section to a small bar and gives that
space back to the graph. **Show details** restores it. A manual choice stays in
effect while selecting other nodes or switching roadmap views, without changing
zoom, progress or your backup. This applies to checkpoint, case-study and concepts views.
During the **Full mission roadmap** lesson, a compact coach guides the map controls.
If you open the map from another tutorial chapter, a **Back to tutorial** bar pauses
that lesson without changing its step. Both layouts leave room for the map.

Optional and forecast stages remain visible without invented progress. A completed track
has no current-step glow. Existing DSA v1/v2 workspaces retain their actual tracker under
**My saved tracker**; adopting the complete version remains the separate confirmed action
described above.

You do **not** need to upload the PDFs or import a JSON file to obtain these roadmaps.
They are already part of the website. **Reload sample is not a PDF import**: it replaces
the current workspace with fictional examples. A new browser starts without assumed
progress; an existing workspace is preserved.

### Learn the controls safely

Click **Tutorial** in the header or sidebar. Follow the glowing target and pointing
hand, perform the indicated action, then select **Next**. Back, Skip and Exit are
available throughout. Exit returns to your real workspace; practice changes are discarded.
Highlight borders sit outside the content with breathing room around headings and controls.
The coach also uses padded, bordered panels; the overlay never changes the target's layout.
Use **Drag to move** at the top of the floating coach to move it with a mouse or
touch. Your chosen position stays across steps while the tutorial is open and is
kept inside the viewport. **Reset position** returns to automatic placement.
With the handle focused, arrow keys move it, Shift moves farther, and Home resets;
Escape cancels an active drag. The compact full-roadmap bars remain docked to keep
the map canvas clear. Position is not written to your workspace or backup.

The tutorial covers actual controls using temporary data. Its files are named
`careerhq-tutorial-example-*`, not real backups. It teaches the interface, not the
mission subjects. A deliberately older **practice** Service Fabric tracker lets you
preview, adopt and inspect an archived roadmap without changing your real version.

Use the **Chapter** menu to work on one area at a time:

| Chapter | What you practice |
| --- | --- |
| 3D career graph | Real-data colors, graph navigation, named-node search and inspection without awarding progress |
| Keep going | Your own past accomplishments, completed work versus practice, and private history that never awards checkpoint credit |
| DSA practice library | Selecting a source section, filtering by printed difficulty, and distinguishing practice references from checkpoint progress |
| System Design concepts | The supplied concepts map, source grouping, pattern-overview guidance and contextual search |
| System Design problems | Module practice sets, changing constraints, source gates, diagnostics and independently selectable case studies |
| PDFs & roadmap updates | Source selection, preview, confirmed adoption, archives, stages, criteria, optional paths, forecasts and project references |
| Complete practice workbooks | Detailed source units, independent practice, exercise checks, shared learning guidance and evidence boundaries |
| Focus room & distractions | Frosted fullscreen room, shared countdown, immediate self-reported distraction records and exported history |
| Full mission roadmap | Opening all stages, zooming, read-only inspection, the glowing current step, panning, Fit all and closing |
| Review & roadmap | Saved-work filtering, recall preparation, partial and independent self-checks, and the mission tree |
| Opportunities | Optional application fields, saving a lead, moving its stage and finding the saved metadata |
| Freelance research | A ten-lead fictional research set, filters, selecting five rows and copying a review brief |
| Settings & backup / How data is stored | Example export/import, replacement warnings, and the real hosted-site device-transfer routine |

Practice-only example buttons make independent chapter visits usable. They add labeled
fictional records only when you click them. They do not create real applications, verify
mastery, or complete source milestones. Clipboard access is optional: if the browser blocks
Copy brief, use the text preview and Skip step rather than treating a failed copy as success.

### A normal working session

**For work you did before using CareerOS:** open **Keep going**. Use **Load personal
history** to review a privately supplied history file, or **Add a past accomplishment**
to record it yourself with its source. The history import adds records without replacing
the workspace; duplicate IDs are not added again, and conflicting replacements are rejected.
Dates are optional rather than guessed. This is separate from mission checkpoint evidence.
Personal history is included in your normal **Export backup** and restored by importing
that workspace backup on another machine. Nothing personal is bundled in the public website.

1. Open a mission. Use **Bring into focus** if it is in the background, then **Make
   primary mission** if you want it considered first. Leave other areas in the background
   when you do not want daily actions for them.
2. Open [Daily plan](https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/#/plan), choose **Gentle**,
   **Steady**, or **Deep focus**, and select **Refresh plan** if today's untouched plan
   needs your latest priorities. A plan with logged actions stays intact.
3. Select **Open checkpoint** and do its **Next action** outside the tracker.
   Read the **Completion criteria** before deciding the checkpoint is finished.
4. Return to that daily action and select **Log progress**. Add an artifact title,
   a truthful description of the work, and optionally an HTTP(S) link. Leave **This
   checkpoint is complete** unchecked to record practice without advancing.
5. When your work demonstrates every criterion, check **This checkpoint is complete**,
   confirm each criterion, and select **Complete & unlock next**.
6. Find the record in **Saved work** and the event in **History**. Use **Export backup**
   in **Settings & data** to keep a private copy.

For example, the documented first DSA checkpoint is **HashMap Fundamentals**:
practice adding, updating and looking up values in a small C# `Dictionary`.
An evidence title might be `Dictionary add/update/lookup practice`; describe what
you actually implemented and what still confused you. Do not paste an example as proof
of work you have not done.

**Daily action done, checkpoint complete, retained recall, and interview ready are
different states.** Logging through a daily action records that action; standalone
mission evidence is not automatically linked back to a daily-plan row. The focus timer
does not log work. Its session is tab-local, and the planned minutes are authored
estimates, not measured learning time.

### Where the other information goes

| Page | Use it for | What it does not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Career graph | Rotate and inspect your career work in 3D, filter missions and records, or copy a private AI brief | No invented progress, automatic AI decisions, or completion from clicking a node |
| Keep going | Read your own source-linked past accomplishments and actual saved work; load private history after reviewing it | No research quotes, generic motivation, invented wins, or automatic checkpoint credit |
| DSA practice library | Browse all 50 expanded DSA sections and curated problem links | No automatic solve tracking, completion credit, or requirement to clear every listed problem |
| System Design concepts | Browse or search the attached one-page roadmap and its repeated pattern contexts | No automatic mastery claims, new required checkpoint gates, or changes to the saved System Forge tracker |
| System Design problems | Work through the 72-module source progression and browse 15 cases, prompts, transfer tasks and diagnostics | No AI assessment, automatic adoption, or mandatory case-to-case completion chain |
| Practice libraries | Browse the seven expanded workbooks, search full study content and open individual modules, labs or references | No automatic completion, execution of source instructions, exam booking or guaranteed outcomes |
| Roadmap | Browse the goal, mission tree and stage flowcharts | Clicking a diagram does not complete work |
| Recall practice | Revisit saved DSA/System Design work from memory | No AI grading or automatic insertion into Daily plan |
| Opportunities | Record roles, application stages and optional effort/resume details | No job search, application submission or resume evaluation |
| Freelance ledger | Research ten leads, classify them, select five and copy a review brief | Adding leads does not complete the Side Income checkpoints |
| Interview readiness | Self-assess five interview skill areas | Ratings are not computed from evidence or completion |
| Settings & data | Change the goal, export and restore private records | Goal text does not instruct an AI planner |

The expanded missions measure source-defined capabilities, not guaranteed income,
employment, contest ratings or professional credentials. AI portfolio choices and
independent case banks are not automatically completed builds. Required certification
study does not imply a required paid exam. Older sprint, phase-review and forecast-only
definitions remain valid for their saved versions and archives.

### A small first review

Start with **one mission**, not all nine. Review its first action and criteria for
clarity and suitability, try saving practice in the tutorial, then locate the result
in Saved work. Also check whether the source page shows the roadmap version you expected.

Useful feedback is: **page/checkpoint + what you expected + what happened**, with a
cropped screenshot if helpful. No private backup or complete PDF is needed to report
an interface problem.

**Local is not encrypted.** Saved work is not a secure vault.
Other JavaScript on the same GitHub Pages origin can read the same localStorage.
Do not enter credentials, confidential material, or sensitive personal information.
Keep exported backups private. Read [Privacy](PRIVACY.md) before entering real data.
Saving and exporting share a 5 MiB compact UTF-8 limit so accepted workspaces remain importable.
Larger writes fail without replacing the previous saved workspace.

### Current boundaries worth knowing

The documents' full teaching, coached assessment, exercise ladders and strategic
planning rules are not implemented. Some checkpoints summarize a broad topic group or
phase; completing that short checklist is not proof of mastery of the whole subject.
Use the original learning material for the full practice progression.
The [integration review](OPERATION-SOURCES.md#review-findings-structure-is-not-a-complete-course)
lists specific content gaps, including narrowed Service Fabric requirements, missing
hands-on obligations and phase reviews that are not next-lesson instructions.

There is no normal edit/delete interface for saved evidence or lead details; opportunity
stages and freelance verdicts can be changed. Evidence can be added only to an active,
unblocked mission's current unfinished checkpoint. After a documented track is complete,
its ordinary evidence workflow cannot record more practice. Recall remains available
for eligible previous DSA/System Design work.

Recall is self-reported. A failed review flags **Needs review**, but the present algorithm
can reuse older spaced successes when a subsequent independent review restores
**Retained**; it does not require a fresh spaced recovery cycle. Treat that badge as a
tracking aid rather than an assessment.

## Persistence and changing machines

There are **no user profiles, accounts, streak counters, or automatic cloud sync**.
Progress uses localStorage for the current browser and site origin (scheme, domain,
and port), not a server account. Refreshing retains compatible data. This revision safely
converts v1 storage to data format v2 while keeping its previous roadmap positions, evidence,
plans and history. The storage key remains compatible with existing installations.

Adopting a documented roadmap is a separate, confirmed action on its mission or Operation
documents page. It archives the previous position and starts the new definition without
inventing completion credit. Saved work remains visible by its original version. Future
schema or roadmap changes require explicit migrations, not silent resets.

To move devices or browsers, export a backup, transfer it privately, and import it
on the destination. Moving from the local preview to GitHub Pages also requires this:
they are different origins. Clearing site data or deleting a browser profile can
remove local progress. Export regularly; import replaces the destination after confirmation.

## Develop and verify

Use a current Node.js LTS release and npm.

Text uses `rem` units and the shared `--type-scale` value in `src/typography.css`.
The current scale is **1.5×** the original typography, without page zoom. Keep new
font sizes relative to this scale; layouts should wrap rather than shrink the text.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run validate
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
```

The development site is `http://127.0.0.1:5173/CareerOS/`.
Playwright builds the production app and manages Vite preview on port `4173`, reusing
an existing server outside CI. Use a production preview at that address, not a dev server:
the browser tests should exercise the shipped content-security policy.
Local E2E tests use installed Microsoft Edge (`msedge`); CI uses Playwright
Chromium. If the required browser is genuinely absent, install it before testing:
`npx playwright install chromium` for CI, or install Microsoft Edge for local runs.
If port `4173` belongs to another process, leave it alone and set `CAREERHQ_E2E_PORT`
to a free port before running the tests (PowerShell: `$env:CAREERHQ_E2E_PORT='4174'`).

Browser coverage includes navigation and deep-link reload, desktop screenshots,
390px/320px layouts, local persistence, evidence/criteria, capacity, filters,
pipeline changes, backup replacement/rejection, and stale-tab protection.
Screenshots and failure traces are in `test-results`;
the HTML report is in `playwright-report`. Test contexts use only synthetic records.

## Deployment and troubleshooting

The Vite base is `/CareerOS/`, matching the repository name. Routes use hashes, such as
`/CareerOS/#/mission/pattern`, so reloading a deep link does not require server rewrites.
`npm run build` produces `dist`; **only that build output belongs in the Pages artifact**.
Do not publish local backups, browser reports, source-reference documents, or context stores.

For the first deployment, a repository administrator must select **Settings → Pages →
Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**. The `Validate and deploy CareerOS`
workflow then validates, builds, runs browser coverage, and deploys on pushes to `main`.
It can also be run manually from Actions. If a run happened before Pages was enabled,
rerun it after selecting that source.

The production HTML carries a restrictive content-security policy and makes no external
runtime requests. Only Vite development mode removes that policy to allow its inline
hot-refresh preamble; the built static HTML retains the policy.

The application is at **https://zanark.github.io/CareerOS/**, not the GitHub repository
file listing. Use the exact `/CareerOS/` project path.

If the website is missing or appears outdated:

1. Open [repository Pages settings](https://github.com/Zanark/CareerOS/settings/pages).
   An administrator must select **GitHub Actions** as the build source.
2. Open [Validate and deploy CareerOS](https://github.com/Zanark/CareerOS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml).
   Select the latest `main` run and inspect **both** `build` and `deploy`.
3. If the source setting was just corrected, use **Re-run all jobs** on that run, or
   **Run workflow** with branch `main`. A green build alone does not establish deployment.
4. If either job fails, open its failed step. Fix the reported error rather than clearing
   browser storage or rerunning blindly. The old "Read Pages configuration: Not Found"
   error means Pages needs the source setting above.
5. After both jobs succeed, open the website link and hard-refresh with **Ctrl+Shift+R**.
   Do not clear site data: that can delete your private progress.

Failed browser runs retain their synthetic test reports and traces in the
`browser-failure-diagnostics` Actions artifact for seven days. Inspect the failing
test rather than treating a successful compile as a successful deployment.

Repository administration and Git push permissions can differ. A user who can push
may still need the owner to change Pages settings.

Implementation entry points: `src/App.tsx` (`Workspace`), `src/dialogs.tsx`
(`EvidenceDialog`), `src/useWorkspace.ts` (`useWorkspace`), `src/domain/catalog.ts`
(`missions`), and `src/domain/engine.ts` (`parseState`, `generatePlan`, `recordEvidence`).

## README artwork

The root README uses original editorial illustrations, not screenshots or personal
progress. Each panel explains one idea: the tracker, document-derived roadmaps, the
working loop, or manual data portability. Native Markdown supplies links and the
important limitations; image alt text provides a text alternative.

Editable sources are `docs/images/readme-*.svg`. Their `readme-*.png` counterparts are
rendered with the existing Playwright dependency:

```sh
node scripts/render-readme.mjs
```

The renderer uses Microsoft Edge on Windows and Chromium elsewhere. Keep fonts local
and text large enough for a narrow README column. Older `overview.png`, `roadmap.png`,
and `tutorial.png` remain genuine fresh-workspace/practice screenshots, not user records.
