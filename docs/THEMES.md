# CareerOS appearance

**DeepSeaFoam** is the default dark theme. The header switch changes to **Harbor
Daylight**, its warm-paper and sea-glass light companion, with a brief sunrise or
sunset. Reduced-motion preferences suppress that animation.

The north-up scene uses **east on the right and west on the left**. The sun rises
from the right and sets on the left, continuing counter-clockwise over successive
days. Retargeting uses the actual current angle and the next matching phase, so
quick clicks do not restart the motion or accumulate extra revolutions.

The sun and moon share one compositor-friendly orbit with a 1.2-second easing
curve. Sky, stars and two small daytime clouds fade locally; clouds also drift
slightly. Six transform/opacity effects animate the control.
The pale-blue daytime sky, outlined yellow sun and soft daylight clouds use the
same palette lineage. Night retains the deep-water sky with clouds hidden.

The rest of the page changes through one composited opacity layer: a short
350 ms cover in the deep-water color, followed by a 1050 ms gentle reveal.
The palette switches only while fully covered, preventing a sudden light flash.
A cutout leaves the sun/cloud scene visible, and the layer does not block clicks.
Rapid requests are coalesced or queued rather than cutting a fade off abruptly.
Reduced-motion settings skip the page fade. This uses standard Web Animations,
not per-element color transitions or native snapshot transitions that block
interaction on some browsers. Tutorial exit and external preference changes
cancel any pending practice fade safely.

The local preference uses `careerhq.theme.v1`, separately from career workspace
data. Workspace export, import and reset do not include or change appearance.
Theme switches during the tutorial are temporary and do not overwrite that preference.
If preference storage is unavailable, switching still works for the current tab
and the interface explains that it could not save the choice.

## Career OS identity

CareerOS is a **career operating system**, not a general life-management operating system.
The logo is an original orbital network around a luminous ivory core,
using blue, violet, orange and rose identity hues. It replaces the earlier
interlocking-loop mark. Film-reference images are not used as application assets.

[`src/assets/careerhq-mark.svg`](../src/assets/careerhq-mark.svg) is the single
editable source for navigation, safe recovery and the favicon. Vite emits a
content-hashed asset so updated tabs and the app use the same mark. It echoes the
current graph: blue, violet and orange orbital lanes, flat glowing dots with
same-color circumference borders, a smaller rose inner orbit, and orange network connections behind an opaque
ivory core. The deep-water tile and canonical DeepSeaFoam colors stay consistent in both themes;
the surrounding wordmark follows the current theme's heading and muted roles. The logo is
static artwork, not a display of today's workspace activity; its dots have no sphere lighting.

The home graph is a real WebGL 3D scene with an original procedural core, meaningful
data orbits, sparks and luminous depth. Its stage remains deep-water in both themes.
The canvas-first layout uses a compact toolbar, a floating camera dock and bounded
on-demand panels instead of permanent filter/list stacks. Controls keep their
accessible names on small screens; graph-only sizing does not change other pages.
Bright green `#45D072` is reserved for **completed checkpoints**, including archived ones;
orange marks unfinished checkpoints. Mission hubs keep their mission hue and records
use their collection hue, even for a done daily action or past accomplishment.
Names/status labels still explain those records; notes do not award mastery.
Real connections use fine, glowing DeepSeaFoam orange
`#F34B00` strokes; hovering bends their interiors away from the cursor without detaching
their endpoints. The maximum push is 56 CSS pixels at the fitted view, tapering
with the square root of relative camera distance as you zoom in.
Nine mission orbits use the saved roadmap's stages and checkpoint statuses;
six record/reference orbits show the appropriate collection groups and counts.
All fifteen rings have distinct nongreen identity hues from `src/missionVisuals.ts`.
Only the nine mission rings start visible. Collection paths, dots and tethers are
hidden by default, including in the focus backdrop; their underlying work/reference
nodes are not hidden. Main-graph collection rings can be enabled individually through
Nodes or the ring inspector's explicit reveal action.
The nine mission hues match the Missions interface. Ring checkpoint ticks vary in intensity,
not by repainting the ring green. Background/planned missions retain those hues on their
rings, dots, ticks and tethers, but use smaller near-core radii and no independent animation.
Focus mode controls placement and motion, not loss of color or saved completion.
Stage marks stay together as active rings turn.
Their moving anchors remain attached to genuine hubs or selected members by
stretching membership tethers. These are derived views, excluded from work totals.
Orbit anchors are **flat glowing dots** with an even-color body and thicker same-color
circumference border (32 CSS pixels including the edge, 36 when selected). No directional
sphere lighting or planet shading remains. A mission border is bright after any saved
evidence/progress or recall result today and dim otherwise; selection does not fabricate
a worked day. The shader uses border strength 1 for worked today and 0.18 otherwise.
Collection borders stay at 0.55 and make no mission-activity claim. Saved-status packets
remain small and separate.
Selection adds a brighter, thicker full-circumference glow in the ring's hue,
including when a single stage/group is selected. It follows the real ring geometry,
retains quiet-ring stillness, and respects Rings visibility and Clear center.
Full-shell projection is the default; **Clear center** masks ring paths rather
than their data anchors. **Rings** hides the orbit paths, anchors and tethers;
**Sparks** independently hides the decorative particles. Both start enabled.
**Checkpoints**, also on by default, hides tracked, archived and untracked curriculum
checkpoint nodes without hiding mission hubs, records or rings. It preserves framing
and is view-only; explicit reveal can restore this layer without enabling Sparks.
Spark amount defaults to 50% of the previous budget: 900 desktop / 450 compact dots
in the main view and 150 / 88 in focus (half of the odd 175-point budget rounds to 88).
The main-view slider spans 0-100%; 100% restores the previous full budget.
Neither removes real work nodes, connection glow or the actual core-node aura.
The white CareerOS center and its inner halo are opaque, so underlying connection
lines cannot show through; only the outer glow has a soft falloff.
An optional ten-second core heartbeat sends a travelling radial displacement through
the meshes from that same node. It does not draw a standalone white ring: the meshes
move gently outward and return without layout drift. The core stays fixed and opaque,
work-node status colors stay unchanged, and labels/picking follow the displayed positions.
Quiet mission rings remain fixed during the heartbeat, with tethers still attached
to the displayed work nodes.
Focus mode centers the camera on the core and removes viewport-dependent backdrop
offsets, keeping the ripple source centered behind the frosted timer.
Its graph is a fixed snapshot taken on opening. The shared local-date gate dims stale
mission activity borders after midnight in both main and focus views, even while paused,
without rebuilding the focus snapshot. Streaks describe recorded local-calendar work
days, not attention, checkpoint completion or live telemetry.
Glow and sparks remain decorative; orbit motion is not evidence of a connected AI
or progress by itself. **Pause animation** is separate from camera orbit and inspection.
Reduced motion starts paused, while direct pointer/keyboard navigation remains available.

## Roles and integration

`src/themes.css` loads after the existing layout stylesheet. The root contract is
`html[data-theme="dark"|"light"]`; prefixed `--dsf-*` tokens supply page, surface,
paper, reading ink, headings, controls and status colors. Layout and typography
remain in `src/styles.css`. The switch owns its decorative animation separately.

Canonical theme-role solids are copied without recoloring. Mission/collection identities
use the separate application palette below, not a claim that every added identity hue is
a canonical DeepSeaFoam token. Dark cards use the panel role;
daylight cards use paper, distinct from structural sea-glass surfaces. Hero,
north-star and guide panels deliberately remain inverse in both modes.

### The full accent palette

The neutral workspace stays deep-water / warm-paper, but teal is not the only
content color. `src/missionVisuals.ts` supplies the shared mission accents and graph
collection identities; `missionAccentStyle` supplies the same mission `--accent` to UI
components. `src/accents.css` carries those accents into visible headings,
card borders, navigation identities, daily rows and roadmap stages, including
when a workspace has zero completed checkpoints.

| Mission / operation | Identity hue |
| --- | --- |
| DSA / Pattern Forge | Blue `#268BD2` |
| System Design / System Forge | Violet `#6C71C4` |
| Job Switch / Escape Velocity | Orange `#F34B00` |
| Service Fabric / Fabric Core | Rose `#E84A5F` |
| Architecture / Blueprint | Magenta `#D33682` |
| Certifications / Credential Forge | Yellow `#EBE565` |
| AI Engineering / Neural Edge | Cyan `#28B7C9` |
| Competitive programming / Algorithm Forge | Lavender `#A989D8` |
| Freelance / Side Income | Amber `#C89459` |

| Graph collection | Identity hue |
| --- | --- |
| Daily work | Pink `#F4A6B8` |
| Saved evidence | Sky blue `#85BADB` |
| Applications | Copper `#D97938` |
| Freelance leads | Silver `#C3CCD4` |
| Past accomplishments | Orchid `#B65CBE` |
| Untracked curriculum | Slate `#829AA6` |

These stable identities do not depend on mission mode or completion. Silver/slate
collection hues do not mean a mission is in the background. Navigation, timer,
primary-action and semantic theme roles remain separate from graph identities.
Colored ink is an explicit application adaptation: mix the
identity color with the current heading ink (72% accent in dark mode, 28% in
daylight). This keeps small labels readable instead of putting raw yellow or
violet text on an unsuitable background. These derived inks and 9% paper washes
are not new canonical palette solids.

Overview counters and personal-history cards have distinct accents. Full-map
stage bands aid scanning; the actual current checkpoint still has its labeled
seafoam glow, and completed states still use the green status signal. A rose
mission border is an identity, not an error. Errors retain their explicit
messages and boundaries; color never replaces a name, status label, or icon.
Primary actions, keyboard focus and tutorial glows stay seafoam for consistency.
Print uses light paper and ink even when the on-screen theme is dark.
